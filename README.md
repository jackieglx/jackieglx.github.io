## Project Reflection

### What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?

The most challenging part of this assignment was designing multiple pages and making them cohesive and user-friendly. I’m not an artistic person, so it took me a lot of time to choose colors and elements.

### Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS? How long did this overall assignment take you?

It is definitely challenging, especially when trying to make the layout responsive on different devices. This assignment took me at least 10 hours to complete. Sometimes, I couldn't figure out why there was a big blank space in a small window but not in a larger one. I struggled with adjusting the CSS to resolve these issues.

### What decisions did you make when making your site mobile-friendly?

I changed elements that were horizontally aligned on larger screens to vertically aligned layouts on smaller devices. This allowed the content to fit more naturally on mobile screens without causing overflow or distortion. I also adjusted font sizes, button sizes, and padding to ensure the site was easy to navigate on touchscreens. Additionally, I optimized images and reduced their sizes for better performance on mobile.

### What did you take into account when developing the design of your website? Is there anything you’re particularly proud of?

I focused on creating a style that felt personal and reflected my own preferences. I chose a color scheme that I like and represents my style and personality. I aimed for a clean, minimalistic look to ensure the content is easy to read and navigate. I'm particularly proud of how the color scheme and typography turned out.

### Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?

I would like to add more interactive animations to make the website feel more dynamic and engaging. Additionally, I want to incorporate Google Fonts to improve typography and use FontAwesome icons for a more polished look. I also plan to add a dark mode toggle button for users who prefer that viewing experience.

### How many hours did you spend on this assignment?

This assignment took me at least 10 hours to complete. A large part of that time was spent on designing and ensuring that the layout was responsive across various screen sizes. The process of testing on different devices and making adjustments also contributed to the time spent.
